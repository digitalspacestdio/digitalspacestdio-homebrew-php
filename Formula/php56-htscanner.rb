  def caveats
    super + <<~EOS
      With this small modification in htscanner,
      you can force it to always use the default docroot set in the php.ini configuration.

      Getting back to the previous example,
      assuming you are hosting your vhosts under /home/public_html,
      you might set the following parameters :

        htscanner.default_docroot = /home
        htscanner.force_default_docroot = 1

        and place a .htaccess inside /home/ that cannot be modified/deleted (and even not be read) by the user.
